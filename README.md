# Weighted depth first search
I have used a dicionary to store the nodes with their distance values from the connecting nodes
Sorting function is used to arrange the 2D lists in ascending order
Acending order function is used to convert the 2D list in 1D list
I have used a stack which uses LIFO technique.
At the end final list stores all the nodes visited in depth wise pattern according to its weighted cost
